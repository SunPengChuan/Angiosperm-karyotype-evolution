The following words correspond to the abbreviated file names

Ancestral angiosperm karyotype (AAK)
Ancestral Mesangiospermae karyotype (AMAK)
Ancestral monocot karyotype except for Acoraceae (AMK-A)
Ancestral eudicot karyotypes (AEK)

Each ancestor karyotype folder contains four files: ancestor, gff, lens, and pep. The ancestor file mainly records the correspondence between chromosomes and colors, while the gff and pep files provide information about genes. The lens file specifies the number of genes in each chromosome for genome analysis.

The ancestor file is used to record the chromosome information of genome assembly by distinguishing different chromosomes with different colors. The gff file contains annotation information about the genome, including gene location and length. The pep file provides protein sequence information corresponding to genes. These files can help researchers better understand the composition and structure of the genome and conduct gene annotation, comparative analysis, and other research work. Therefore, they are essential foundational data for genome researchers.

The main objective of this ancestral gene set is to provide information about collinearity between different ancestral chromosomes, rather than to serve as a comprehensive collection of genes. This data can be valuable for understanding the evolutionary history and structure of the genome.
